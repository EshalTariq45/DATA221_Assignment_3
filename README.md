question 1- code reads a csv file, and extracts a column (ViolentCrimesPerPop) and then calculates
            the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum, printing them as well. The results 
            show the mean is higher than the median indiciating data to be right skewed with high outliers that
            in turn would affect the average

Question 2- code reads "ViolentCrimesPerPop" column from a CSV, and then creates a histogrand and a boxplot
            where both plots show that most values are low-to-moderate, but the distribution is right-skewed

Question 3- code loads in a kidney disease dataset and seperates the features from the target classification, and 
            the data itno training and testing sets. The training set is used to teach model patterns, and the testing 
            set evalutes the models preformance on new data, which checks for overfitting

Question 4- code cleans the kidney disease dataset, which converts the categorical features into numaeric ones split into 
            training and testing sets, and trains a KNN classifier to predict ifthe patient has chronic kidney disease. Evaluates model using
            predictions and metrics. 

Question 5- code tests different values of k for KNN classifier, records the accuracy on the test set for each k and then
            identifies the k that gives the highest test accuracy.
